HESA-HoneyBeesChecker

Hi Team,
I have created an ASP.Net application with the Bees service application in a class library project and an ASP.net client consuming it.
Time Duration for designing, developing, testing and uploading the BeesHealthChecker project to GIT took approx 2 and half hours.
I have added comments and try catch blocks for exception handling, though the error logging is not et implemented.
